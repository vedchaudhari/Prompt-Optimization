# Token Reduction Algorithm for Text Optimization

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a token reduction algorithm for optimizing text by reducing the number of tokens while preserving important information. The script utilizes text summarization, compression, simplification, and token reduction techniques to optimize the input text.

## Token Reduction Algorithm Overview

The token reduction algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Text Summarization: The input text is summarized using the T5 model from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
2. Text Compression: Redundant words, phrases, or sentences are removed, and long phrases may be replaced with shorter alternatives.
3. Text Simplification: Complex sentences are broken down into simpler, shorter sentences, complex words or phrases may be replaced with simpler equivalents, and explanations or examples may be added to clarify difficult concepts.
4. Token Reduction: The number of tokens in the text is reduced to a specified maximum. Stop words may be removed, and the resulting tokens are trimmed to the desired length.

## Implementation Details

The algorithm is implemented in Python and utilizes the following libraries:

- transformers: For text summarization using the T5 model.
- nltk.tokenize: For tokenizing the text.
- nltk.corpus.stopwords: For removing stop words.

The script provides the following function:

- optimize_text(unoptimized_text, max_tokens): Takes the unoptimized text and the maximum number of tokens as input. It applies the token reduction algorithm and returns the optimized text.

## Setup and Usage Instructions

Follow these instructions to set up and run the script:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd repo

3. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the script file optimize_text.py in a text editor.

5.Modify the unoptimized_text variable with your desired input text.

6. Set the max_tokens variable to the maximum number of tokens for the optimized text.

7. Save the file.

Run the script: 
  python optimize_text.py
